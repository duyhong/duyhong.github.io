title: My experience with Bloc
---
Before Bloc, I have taken several web courses such as `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript`, `jQery`, and `PHP` online and at a community college. However, I could not build a web application by myself. The problem is that I did not know how to start and how to link knowledge I have learned together as well as apply it to create a complete web app. After three years without working on those web languages and technologies, I totally forgot what I have learned. 

Last December, I decided to study web development again, and this time I wanted to study deeper so that I can build web apps by myself. Thus, I chose Bloc Bootcamp' Web Developer Track.

Unlike other web development program which teaches students lots of commands and syntax at beginning as well as teaches the languages/technologies one by one, Bloc teaches students many languages/technologies at the same time and instructs them to apply those languages/technologies in every checkpoint, assignment, and project. In addition, each command/syntax is taught in a context of a specific web app. This helps me to comprehend and remember commands/syntax better, similar to studying a foreign language in contexts. I think this is what makes Bloc special and the best thing for me.

Furthermore, I have worked on three major projects so far with my mentor's help. I have had chances to apply what I have learned from Bloc into these projects. I can get help from my mentor any time I need. This project-based curriculum and one-on-one mentorship make Bloc the best bootcamp as well as are the best approach to study and become a web developer.
